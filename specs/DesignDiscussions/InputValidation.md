# Input Validation

Input validation was originally spec'd in issue [#3081](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/3081). This document covers the basics from that spec, and continues the discussion of additional concerns that it raised.

## Schema Additions to Inputs for Validation

``` json
{
    "type": "Input.Text",
    "id": "username",
    "isRequired": true,
    "regex": "^\\w{5,50}$",
    "errorMessage": "Username must be between 5 and 50 characters long."
}
```
All `Input.*` types will have the `"isRequired"`, and `"errorMessage"` properties added to them. These properties allow a card author to specify whether or not an input is required, and what error message should be shown in case of invalid user input.

Additionally, a `regex` property will be added to `Input.Text` to allow card authors to specify what regular expression defines valid input,

## Validation Rendering

By default, required inputs should be marked with a *. In cases where a label has been specified, the required indicator should be placed next to the input's label. Further discussion of label formatting can be found in [InputLabels.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/master/specs/DesignDiscussions/InputLabels.md), tracked by [Issue #203](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/203).

The error text and invalid indication will be rendered in the host's `attention` color.

## Input Validation Behavior

### When to Validate

Issue [#3081](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/3081) covers research and best practices behind when to validate. The conclusion reached there is as follows:
 - Validate the input when it loses focus for the first time.
 - Once the field has been marked invalid, validate on each keystroke so the user can see when it becomes valid.

 This is also consistent with the behavior recently adopted by WinUI 3.0 for their input validation feature.

 That being said, our hosts may have a variety of existing behaviors in their apps. In order to support consistency within host apps, we will allow the host to configure the validation behavior via host config. 

 Possible values:
 - First Validation on focus lost (default behavior)
 - First Validation on action
 - First Validation on focus lost only if the user has typed something

 For any of the above values, validation will happen for un-validated fields on action, and focus will be placed in the first invalid input.

### Which Input Properties to Validate

For this feature we are adding the `isRequired` property to all inputs and the `regex` property to Input.Text. These properties should be validated using the validation methods described in this document.

In addition to these new properties, there are several existing properties that indicate valid values for an input. Currently, these existing properties are enforced on some platforms whose UI controls allow them to be enforced natively in the UI. For example `Input.Date` has `min` and `max` properties. Ideally, this is implemented as a calendar picker in which dates outside the supported range are greyed out. Currently, however, only some platforms support this behavior due to the presence or absence of a native control with that functionality.

With the advent of this input validation feature, those platforms which do not support these properties should use the input validation behavior described in this spec to add support. Enforcing them natively in the UI by preventing the user from picking an invalid value is still preferred, but when that is not feasible, input validation should be used in these cases. Considering this, the full list of properties that should be either enforced or validated are:

|Input|Properties||
|---|---|---
|Input.Text|regex <br> maxLength|New for this feature <br> ExistingProperty
|Input.Number|min, max|Existing Properties
|Input.Date|min, max|Existing Properties
|Input.Time|min, max|Existing Properties
|Input.Date|min, max|Existing Properties
|**All inputs** |isRequired |New for this feature

### Which Inputs to Validate
The primary purpose of client side input validation is to validate a users inputs before they submit them. In this case, the card author would want us to validate all inputs before they are submitted:

``` json
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.3",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "First Name:"
        },
        {
            "type": "Input.Text",
            "id": "firstName",
            "isRequired": true
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Last Name:"
        },
        {
            "type": "Input.Text",
            "id": "lastName",
            "isRequired": true
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Submit"
        }
    ]
}
```

The story becomes more complicated, however, with more complicated cards. Should we validate cards hidden behind collapsed show cards or toggles? Should we validate on action types other than submit? If a hidden element is blocking submit of a form, the user will not be able to see the errors or requirements that are causing their form not to submit. This is not a great user experience. Consider the following options for addressing it:
 
#### Validating all fields
If we validate all fields in the card, that means that there can be scenarios where validation fails on inputs that are not currently on the screen. If a required input is hidden behind a toggle or a show card, the user could be confused as to why they are unable to submit. Additionally, depending on the card design, the card author's intent may not be to validate all fields. In our food order scenario card, for example, clearly only the input fields on the current sub card are relevant to the submit. The card author may want the answer to "How would you like your steak prepared?" to be required for users ordering steak, but not for users ordering chicken.

#### Only validate visible fields

One option would be to only validate fields that are currently visible. This introduces a number of concerns. The first is that currently we send all inputs (visible or not) on a submit action. This means that given the current behavior we would be sending potentially non-validated inputs back to the card author. With client side input validation, the code these are ultimately sent to may expect that they've already been validated. Not validating them would break that expectation.

If we decide not to even *send* the hidden (and therefore not-validated) inputs, this would be a breaking change as today we send *all* inputs on submit.

Finally, as the visibility of an input is ultimately determined by the user, we don't want hiding the input to bypass validation. In the below scenario, closing the personalization card should not allow you to use special characters (nor should it imply you no longer want it personalized).

#### Making hidden element visible on submit
In the above card, showing the collapsed show card at submit would allow us to show the user the errors that are blocking submit. While this may work well in some simple ShowCard cases such as the this one, there are a number of pitfalls. A card that makes use of toggle visibility may have non-trivial logic governing what is shown and what is not shown at any time. Consider the following card built using toggle visibility:

![img](assets/InputValidation/ToggleWizard.gif)

If there was a validation error on the first "page", bringing the hidden element back into focus on submit would result in one of the following, depending on whether we brought back the entire hidden element or just the invalid input. In either case, this is not the expected behavior of this card author, and the subsequent behavior if the toggle buttons are pressed again would not be well defined:

Bring back non-visible card element            |  Bring back single input
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![img](assets/InputValidation/BrokenToggleWizard.PNG)  |  ![img](assets/InputValidation/BrokenToggleWizard2.PNG)

> Note on this card: This "Wizard" scenario is implemented here via toggle visibility. We should consider whether we want to support a first class wizard experience where a new element type could list a series of subcards to display in order. Whether or not we ever introduce such a concept, the point remains that toggle logic may be complex, and we shouldn't be arbitrarily toggling things visible outside the scope of what the card author has defined in their toggle buttons.

#### Current Card/Container

Considering the food order card above, one option in show card scenarios may be to validate the current show card, or the show card and any parent cards. This works well for the food order card, but doesn't help us with card scenarios that include toggles. It may also not be the correct behavior for a mid card action set containing a show card. While it would be nice if we could provide an algorithm that deduces which inputs should be validated, it would be tricky to create an algorithm that gracefully handles all cases. Additionally, the more complicated the algorithm, the harder it is for card authors to understand the expected behavior.

#### Card Author Control

As the discussion above shows, depending on the card scenario, it may be difficult for us to determine which fields the card author wants to validate. Any of the above approaches may be correct for *some* cards, but none are appropriate for all cards. In order to address this, the best approach is to allow the card author to specify which inputs are associated with a given action. We will implement this via a new `associatedInputIds` property on Action types. The inputs listed will be the ones that are validated, and also the ones that are returned on Submit.

The first option available for inputs is "All." This will validate and submit all inputs on the card. This is the current behavior, and would be the default for submit actions.
```json
{
	"type": "Action.Submit",
	"title": "Submit",
	"associatedInputIds": "All",
}
```

The second option would be "None". This would be useful for, for example, a "Cancel" button where validation is not required, and would be the default for non-Submit action types (see further discussion of validation for different action types below).
```json
{
	"type": "Action.Submit",
	"title": "Cancel",
	"associatedInputIds": "None",
}
```
For authors that need more granular control of which inputs to validate, we would also allow them to specify a list of inputs, such as the following:
```json
{
	"type": "Action.Submit",
	"title": "Submit",
	"associatedInputIds": ["input1Id", "input2Id"] 
}
```
In order to allow authors to group their inputs, we will also accept container ids. This allows the card author to functionally define a "form" and indicate that the submit button relates to that form.
```json
{
	"type": "Action.Submit",
	"title": "Submit",
	"associatedInputIds": ["input1Id", "input2Id", "formContainerId"] 
}
```
Container IDs can be ids on a `Container`, `Column`, `ColumnSet` or `Card`. An `id` property will be added to the AdaptiveCard type to support this behavior, which will allow card authors to select, for example, a show card as the associated input container. Card id's are not currently part of the schema and exist today only in JavaScript.

##### On Not Adding a Form Type

The design described above allows card authors to use containers as "forms" by specifying them as the inputs for a submit action, but does not introduce an explicit `form` type. While semantically typing specific containers as forms seems appealing, we don't have any use cases today where we need that information. One could imagine a scenario in the future where we would want to add properties to forms, but given that the use cases for cards are small pieces of UI, it's unlikely that we'd configure forms at the container level rather than at the card or host level. Additionally, introducing a new type has a backwards compatibility impact, as unknown types will be dropped on earlier versions. Because of these considerations, the benefits of adding a new type are outweighed by the drawbacks. Card authors can use our existing container types to contain their forms.

##### Defaulting to All
As discussed above, validating all fields can lead to issues if pieces of the validated UI are hidden from the user. That said, there are a few reasons **defaulting** to all is the right approach:

- In the simplest case, "All" is likely the correct choice. A card which is a simple form with a submit button on the bottom will likely want to validate and submit all fields.

- It is important that the submitted fields are the same as those that are validated. Sending inputs that have validation without enforcing that validation may lead to issues on the server side if the server has assumed that their specified client side validation is dependable. Today, we submit all inputs with each submit, and changing that would be a breaking change for existing cards. Using All as the default allows us to (a) not break the current submit all inputs behavior and (b) not send any un-validated inputs.

- By default we will validate on focus lost, so in a host with that behavior a user who has navigated to and away from an input will have seen the validation error, even if they subsequently hid it using a toggle or show card action. This means that in scenarios where the input is not required, but has a regex or other validation (such as the personalization example above) the user will already be aware that their field has not validated correctly. The scenario where a **required** input is not shown may be confusing to a user, but one could make the case that it's questionable card design to hide required fields behind toggle or show card actions.

- If "All" doesn't work well for a particular  card, allowing the card author to explicitly specify inputs allows them to override this default behavior to configure the validation as appropriate for their scenario.

### Validation and Actions

#### Action Types
Although submit actions are the most obvious case for input validation, we will support validation on all action types. The `associatedInputIds` property will indicate which fields are validated.

##### Submit Actions
Submit actions will default to `"associatedInputIds": "All"`. This means that all inputs on the card will be validated and sent with this submission. Card authors can adjust this default behavior by setting the `associatedInputIds` property to a different value as described above.

##### Toggle and ShowCard Actions
In many cases, it likely doesn't make sense to validate on show card or toggle actions if those actions are simply showing more details that don't need to appear on the main card. In some cases, however, either show card or toggle may be used to reveal the next step in a progression through the card experience. The wizard card above is a clear example of this. The card author may want to validate the first "page" before allowing the user to proceed to the second. Even the FoodOrder card can be viewed as an example of using show cards to progress through an interaction. If the upper portion of the card contained addition inputs, the card author may want to validate those fields before proceeding to ask additional questions about the users order. 

Because by default Toggles and ShowCards don't necessarily need to validate inputs, these actions will default to `"associatedInputIds": "None"`. We will, however, support the ability to set a different value to enforce validation of some or all of the inputs before allowing the user to take one of these actions.

##### OpenUrl
Today it is unlikely that there are many scenarios to validate inputs on OpenUrl, so the default value for `associatedInputIds` will be `None`. For consistency, however, we will allow `associatedInputIds` to be set on OpenUrl actions.

If we in the future allow inputs to be used to construct the Url, any explicitly referenced inputs can be added to those checked by `associatedInputIds`.

#### Disabling Actions

We will not disable actions that require further validation. Clicking on a action that still has unvalidated fields will show any unshown validation errors, but will not invoke the action. This ensures that all error's are shown to the user and they understand why they cannot proceed.

## Custom Rendering Error Messages
Comments in [#3081](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/3081) from dclaux:
> showInputValidationErrors: this needs to be introduced as well as a way for a host to custom render these error messages. We've had a very long debate around this.

And andrewleader:
>showInputValidationErrors for renderers (via code) makes sense

This refers to allowing hosts to add custom rendering via code for showing validation errors. Perhaps they wish to show their errors in the style of tooltips, for example, instead of inline under the image. Currently, we view this as a P2 feature. That said, we may be willing to accept a feature inconsistency here if this is required for JavaScript in v1 of input validation, and add it to other platforms in future versions as the need arises and time allows.

## Backwards Compatibility
All new properties added for input validation will be ignored when sent to earlier versions of Adaptive Cards. This has the following impact:
 - Required Inputs will not be marked with any indication that they are required
 - Validation properties will not be checked or enforced. Error messages will not be shown.
 - Associated inputs will be ignored, and all Submit Actions will be treated as 
 `"associatedInputIds" : "All"`.

## Future and Out of Scope Features

### Success Indicators
Some forms add an indicator to an input once a valid value has been added to give the user feedback that they've entered a valid value. For example, a password field that turns green once the password has reached sufficient complexity. This may be a useful feature for future versions, but is out of scope for v1.

### Cross field validation
There are many scenarios where validation that specifies relationships between fields could be useful. For example requiring a particular field only if another one is filled in, or requiring at least one (or exactly one) of several options is selected. More complicated scenarios, such as a choice in one input changing the available choices in another input, could also be useful.

While this is an area we should investigate in the future, supporting cross field validation is out of scope for v1 of this feature.
